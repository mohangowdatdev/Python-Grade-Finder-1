# Python-Grade-Finder-1
In this code we can find the grades of a student depending on his marks.

<b>Question: </b> Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
  <u>Score Grade </u>
 " >= 9.0 A "<br>
 " >= 8.0 B "<br>
 " >= 7.0 C "<br>
 " >= 6.0 D "<br>
 " < 6.0 F "<br>
   <br>
If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit.

<b>Output </b>
