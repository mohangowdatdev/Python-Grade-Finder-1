# Python-Grade-Finder-1
In this code we can find the grades of a student depending on his marks.

<b>Question: </b> Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
  <u>Score Grade </u>
  > >= 9.0 A <br>
  > >= 8.0 B <br>
  > >= 7.0 C <br>
  >= 6.0 D <br>
  < 6.0 F <br>
   <br>
If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit.
