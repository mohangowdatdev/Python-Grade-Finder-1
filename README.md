# Python-Grade-Finder-1
In this code we can find the grades of a student depending on his marks.

<b>Question: </b> Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
   Score Grade
   >= 9.0 A
   >= 8.0 B
   >= 7.0 C
   >= 6.0 D
   < 6.0 F
   If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit.
